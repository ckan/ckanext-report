# ckanext-report

ckanext-report is a CKAN extension that provides a reporting infrastructure. Here are the features offered:

* All available reports are listed on a central web page and from the command-line.
* Breadcrumbs allow navigation from a report back to the reports page.
* Reports are served as a web page, JSON or CSV from a cache.
* The reports can be run in a nightly batch and saved to the cache.
* Admins can regenerate reports from the report's web page.

Example report:

A number of extensions currently offer reports that rely on this extension, e.g. [ckanext-archiver](https://github.com/datagovuk/ckanext-archiver/blob/master/ckanext/archiver/reports.py), [ckanext-qa](https://github.com/datagovuk/ckanext-qa/blob/master/ckanext/qa/reports.py), [ckanext-dgu](https://github.com/datagovuk/ckanext-dgu/blob/master/ckanext/dgu/lib/reports.py).

TODO:

* Stop a report from being generated multiple times in parallel (unnecessary waste) - use a queue?
* Stop more than one report being generated in parallel (high load for the server) - maybe use a queue.

Compatibility: Requires CKAN version 2.1 or later (but can be easily adapted for older versions).

Status: in production at data.gov.uk but since that uses its own CSS rather than core CKAN's, for others to use it CSS needs adding. For an example, see this branch: see https://github.com/yaditi/ckanext-report/tree/geoversion

## Install & setup

Install ckanext-report into your CKAN virtual environment in the usual way:

    (pyenv) $ pip install -e git+https://github.com/datagovuk/ckanext-report.git#egg=ckanext-report

Initialize the database tables needed by ckanext-report:

    (pyenv) $ paster --plugin=ckanext-report report initdb --config=mysite.ini

Enable the plugin. In your config (e.g. development.ini or production.ini) add ``report`` to your ckan.plugins. e.g.:

    ckan.plugins = report


## Command-line interface

The following operations can be run from the command line using the ``paster --plugin=ckanext-report report`` command:

```
  report list
    - lists the reports

  report generate [report1,report2,...]
    - generate the specified reports, or all of them if none specified
```

Get the list of reports:

    (pyenv) $ paster --plugin=ckanext-report report list --config=mysite.ini

Generate all reports:

    (pyenv) $ paster --plugin=ckanext-report report generate --config=mysite.ini

Generate a single report:

    (pyenv) $ paster --plugin=ckanext-report report generate <report name> --config=mysite.ini


## Demo report - Tagless Datasets

There is a simple demonstration report included in ckanext-report which you can enable by adding `tagless_report` to your list of `ckan.plugins` in your ckan.ini. Once you've restarted paster or whichever webserver, you should see it listed on the webpage at: `/report`.


## Dataset Notes

Reports that examine datasets include a column 'Dataset Notes', designed to show custom properties of the datasets. There are often key properties that you want to show, such as whether a dataset is private, harvested etc., but it is configurable because every CKAN install is different. To configure the contents of this: put a python expression in the CKAN config `ckanext-report.notes.dataset`.

For example at data.gov.uk we flag up if a dataset is 'unpublished', has been harvested or was imported from ONSHUB:

```
ckanext-report.notes.dataset = ' '.join(('Unpublished' if asbool(pkg.extras.get('unpublished')) else '', 'UKLP' if asbool(pkg.extras.get('UKLP')) else '', 'National Statistics Pub Hub' if pkg.extras.get('external_reference')=='ONSHUB' else ''))
```

# Creating a Report

A report has three key elements:

1. Report Code - a python function that produces the report.
2. Template - HTML for displaying the report data.
3. Registration - containing the configuration of the report.

The examples below are taken from the worked example "Tagless datasets" in this repository - see above for how to run this demo.


## Report Code

The code that produces the report will probably make some calls to the logic layer or database, assemble the data into dicts/lists and then return them. This will be saved as JSON in the database data_cache.

The returned data should be a dict like this:

```javascript
{
    'table': [
        {'name': 'river-levels', 'title': 'River levels', 'notes': 'Harvested', 'user': 'bob', 'created': '2008-06-13T10:24:59.435631'},
        {'name': 'co2-monthly', 'title' 'CO2 monthly', 'notes': '', 'user': 'bob', 'created': '2009-12-14T08:42:45.473827'},
    ],
    'num_packages': 56,
    'packages_without_tags_percent': 4,
    'average_tags_per_package': 3.5,
}
```

There should be a `table` with the main body of the data, and any other totals or incidental pieces of data.

Note: the table is required because of the CSV download facility, and CSV demands a table. (The CSV download only includes the table, ignoring any other values in the data.) Although the data has to essentially be stored as a table, you do have the option to display it differently in the web page by using a clever template.

Dates should be returned as an ISO format string.

The convention is to put the report code in: `ckanext/<extension>/reports.py`

## Template

When you view a report, ckanext-report will automatically show the title, options, the CSV/JSON download buttons and for the administrator a 'refresh' button. Everything below that, the display of the data itself, is the job of the report template.

The report template will probably display the incidental data and then the table:

```html
{#
Report (snippet)

table - main data, as a list of rows, each row is a dict
data - other data values, as a dict
#}
<ul>
    <li>Datasets without tags: {{ table|length }} / {{ data['num_packages'] }} ({{ data['packages_without_tags_percent'] }})</li>
    <li>Average tags per package: {{ data['average_tags_per_package'] }} tags</li>
</ul>

<table class="table table-bordered table-condensed tablesorter" id="report-table" style="width: 100%; table-layout:fixed; margin-top: 8px;">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Dataset</th>
        <th>Notes</th>
        <th>User</th>
        <th>Created</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      {% for row in table %}
        <tr>
          <td>
            <a href="{{ h.url_for(controller='package', action='view', id=row.name) }}">
              {{ row.title }}
            </a>
          </td>
          <td>{{ row.notes }}</td>
          <td>{{ h.linked_user(row.user) }}</td>
          <td>{{ h.render_datetime(row.created) }}</td>
        </tr>
      {% endfor %}
    </tbody>
</table>
```

The convention is to put the report templates in: `ckanext/<extension>/templates/report/<report_name>.html`

Note: currently ckanext-report has not been styled yet for the core CKAN templates, due to the author using custom templates. Feel free to add styling.

## Option templates

Each option needs a template snippet containing the widget for the user to change the value. The snippet for selecting the 'organization' is already included, and you can define others.

* It must be located at: `report/option_<option-name>.html`
* It is passed values:
  * value - Value of this option
  * default - Default value for this option
* The widget should be a <form> field, with name: `option-<option-name>` that returns the value for the option when the form is submitted.
* If it is not missing then the report page falls back to just showing the option value (i.e. read-only).

Here's an example of a checkbox for whether to 'include sub-organizations' from 'ckanext/report/templates/report/option_include_sub_organizations.html':
```
{#
Option snippet - organization

value - Value of this option
#}
<span class="form-select control-group control-organization">
    <label class="checkbox">
      <input type="checkbox" name="include_sub_organizations" value="1" class="inline js-auto-submit" {{ 'checked=checked' if value }} />
      Include results from sub-organizations
    </label>
</span>
```

## Registration

Register your report with ckanext-report with the IReport plugin and supply its configuration.

Your extension will probably have a file `plugin.py` defining plugins - classes which inherit from `p.SingletonPlugin`. Make a plugin implement IReport, based on this example plugin.py:

```python
import ckan.plugins as p
from ckanext.report.interfaces import IReport

class TaglessReportPlugin(p.SingletonPlugin):
    p.implements(IReport)

    # IReport

    def register_reports(self):
        import reports
        return [reports.tagless_report_info]
```

The last line refers to `tag_report_info` which is a dictionary with properties of the report. This is stored in `reports.py` together with the report code (see above). The info dict looks like this:

```python
from ckan.common import OrderedDict
tagless_report_info = {
    'name': 'tagless-datasets',
    'description': 'Datasets which have no tags.',
    'option_defaults': OrderedDict((('organization', None),
                                    ('include_sub_organizations', False),
                                    )),
    'option_combinations': tagless_report_option_combinations,
    'generate': tagless_report,
    'template': 'report/tagless.html',
    }
```

Info dict spec:

* name - forms part of the URL
* title (optional) - this is the report title as it is displayed. Defaults to name, capitalized and with dashes changed to spaces.
* description (optional) - this is displayed in the report list page and on the report page.
* generate - function returning the report data
* template - filepath of the report HTML template
* option_defaults - dict of ALL option names and their default values. Use ckan.common.OrderedDict. If there are no options, you can return None.
* option_combinations - function returning a list of all the options combinations (reports for these combinations are generated by default). If there are no options, return None.
* authorize (optional) - a function that says if the user is allowed to view the report. Takes params: (user_object, options_dict) and should return a boolean - if the user is authorized or not. The default is that anyone can see reports.
* paginate_by (optional) - number of items to paginate the report view by. If excluded, pagination will be disabled.

Finally we need to define the function that returns the option_combinations:
```python
def tagless_report_option_combinations():
    for organization in lib.all_organizations(include_none=True):
        for include_sub_organizations in (False, True):
            yield {'organization': organization,
                   'include_sub_organizations': include_sub_organizations}
```

## Translations

To translate plugin to a new language (ie. "pl") run `python setup.py init_catalog -l pl`.

To update template file with new translation added in the code or templates
run `python setup.py extract_messages` in the root plugin directory. Then run
`./ckanext/report/i18n/unique_pot.sh -v` to strip core ckan's translations.

To update translation files for locale "pl" with new template run `python setup.py update_catalog -l pl`.
